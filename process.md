# RSVPY Project Status

## Project Overview
RSVPY is a Next.js application for creating and managing invitations and RSVPs using Supabase. The project features a light ivory background with elegant black buttons and a mobile-friendly design.

## Current Progress
✅ Set up the Next.js application with TypeScript
✅ Configured Tailwind CSS
✅ Created basic UI components (Header, ProtectedRoute)
✅ Set up authentication context using Supabase
✅ Created login, dashboard, and event creation pages
✅ Fixed TypeScript and import path issues
✅ Improved Supabase error handling
✅ Implemented freemium model with subscription tiers
✅ Created pricing page with subscription options
✅ Added event view tracking functionality
✅ Implemented RSVP form with success confirmation
✅ Added database schema with notification settings
✅ Fixed file upload limitations with fallback to placeholders
✅ Consolidated setup documentation

## Business Model
- Free tier available to everyone with no initial restrictions
- Optional subscription plans for premium features to be implemented later
- Premium features will include:
  - Custom image uploads (free tier will use placeholders)
  - Image compression for free tier users (to be implemented)
  - Limit of 3 photos per event for free tier (to be implemented)
  - Removal of RSVPY branding
  - Higher guest limits (free tier will be limited to 50 guests)

## User Flow
We've simplified the initial experience:
1. Users sign up and are directed straight to the dashboard
2. They can immediately create events without going through a setup process
3. Free tier limitations will be applied gradually as the product matures
4. Upgrade CTAs are shown in strategic places (image upload, guest limits, etc.)

## Component Structure
We've refactored the application to use a modular component structure:

```
/app                  - Next.js 13+ App Router pages
  /dashboard          - Main user dashboard
  /event/[id]         - Event management page
  /rsvp/[id]          - Public RSVP page
  /pricing            - Subscription plan options
  /subscribe          - Subscription checkout page (future)

/components           - Reusable UI components
  /pricing            - Pricing-related components
  /setup              - Setup-related components (may be phased out)
```

## Recent Updates
1. Added event view count tracking
2. Implemented RSVP form with success confirmation
3. Added notification settings to database schema
4. Improved file upload with fallback to placeholders
5. Added warning notices for features under development (email)
6. Simplified user onboarding by removing mandatory setup

## Next Steps
1. Complete the RSVP customization features
2. Implement free tier limitations:
   - Limit to 3 photos per event
   - Add image compression for free tier
   - Cap guest list at 50 for free users
3. Set up payment processing with Stripe/PayPal
4. Enable email sending when technical infrastructure is ready
5. Add user profile and settings page
6. Implement analytics dashboard for event owners

## Current Issues to Address
- Email sending functionality is still under development
- Storage bucket policy needs to be properly configured
- Setup page can be phased out for a cleaner user journey

## For the Next Developer
- The `/app/setup` page will eventually be removed, redirecting users directly to the dashboard
- Free tier restrictions should be implemented gradually to avoid friction
- When implementing image limits, add a counter in the ImageUploader component
- For image compression, consider using a client-side solution to avoid server costs

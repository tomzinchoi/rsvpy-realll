# RSVPY Project Status and Development Guide

## Project Overview
RSVPY is a Next.js application for creating and managing invitations and RSVPs using Supabase. The project features a light ivory background with elegant black buttons and a mobile-friendly design.

## Current Progress
✅ Set up the Next.js application with TypeScript
✅ Configured Tailwind CSS
✅ Created basic UI components (Header, ProtectedRoute)
✅ Set up authentication context using Supabase
✅ Created login, dashboard, and event creation pages
✅ Fixed TypeScript and import path issues
✅ Improved Supabase error handling
✅ Implemented freemium model with subscription tiers
✅ Created pricing page with subscription options
✅ Added event view tracking functionality
✅ Implemented RSVP form with success confirmation
✅ Added database schema with notification settings
✅ Fixed file upload limitations with fallback to placeholders
✅ Consolidated setup documentation
✅ Fixed path aliases in tsconfig.json to prevent import errors
✅ Implemented proper null checks for TypeScript safety

## Development Guidelines

### TypeScript Best Practices
1. **Use Type Safety**: Always define interfaces for component props and state
2. **Null Checks**: Add proper null/undefined checks with optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)
3. **Auth Context**: Use the `isLoading` property from AuthContext (not `loading` which is deprecated)

### Component Structure
1. **Client Components**: Use 'use client' directive for client-side components
2. **Loading States**: Implement proper loading states with consistent spinners
3. **Error Handling**: Always include error handling with user-friendly messages

### Supabase Interaction
1. **Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks with the `handleSupabaseError` utility
2. **RLS Policies**: Be aware of Row Level Security when writing queries
3. **Storage**: Use placeholders for images if storage bucket access fails

### File Organization
1. **Components Directory**: Keep reusable UI components here
2. **App Directory**: Use the Next.js App Router structure
3. **Contexts**: Keep context providers in the contexts directory
4. **Lib**: Store utilities and Supabase config in the lib directory

### Email Notifications
1. **Status**: Email notifications are marked as "under development"
2. **Implementation**: Database structure is ready, but actual sending is not implemented
3. **UI**: All UI components show appropriate notices about this feature

### Business Model Implementation
1. **Free Tier**: Currently unlimited, will eventually have restrictions
2. **Premium Features**: Custom image uploads, no branding, higher limits
3. **Subscription Plans**: Premium and Professional tiers are defined

## Next Steps
1. Complete the RSVP customization features
2. Implement free tier limitations:
   - Limit to 3 photos per event
   - Add image compression for free tier
   - Cap guest list at 50 for free users
3. Set up payment processing with Stripe/PayPal
4. Enable email sending when technical infrastructure is ready
5. Add user profile and settings page
6. Implement analytics dashboard for event owners

## Database Schema Updates
The following SQL has been applied to the Supabase database:
1. Base schema with events, rsvps, and email_invitations tables
2. Added notification_settings column to events table
3. Added increment_event_views function
4. Setup storage with appropriate policies

## Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Import Path Issues**: Use the updated `@/*` path mapping in tsconfig.json
2. **Auth Context Type Errors**: Use isLoading instead of loading property
3. **Event New RSVPs Badge**: Always add a null check like: `event.new_rsvps_count !== undefined && event.new_rsvps_count > 0`
4. **Storage Bucket Access**: Handle storage errors gracefully with fallbacks to placeholders

## Future Considerations
- Email sending requires proper SMTP credentials and configuration
- Payment processing will need Stripe or similar integration
- Backups of Supabase data should be implemented
- Consider serverless functions for heavy processing tasks

## Next Steps for RSVPY(thoughts)
Based on our progress so far, here are the next steps I'd recommend for your RSVPY project:

1. User Experience Enhancements
Dashboard Improvements
Add event filtering and search functionality
Implement drag-and-drop event organization
Create a calendar view that shows all events chronologically
RSVP Form Customization
Allow users to add custom fields with more types (dropdowns, multiple choice)
Add theme customization for RSVP forms
Enable conditional questions based on previous answers
Mobile Experience
Ensure perfect mobile responsiveness for all pages
Add mobile-specific features like adding events to phone calendars
Implement share buttons for social platforms
2. Monetization Implementation
Complete Subscription Features
Implement actual payment processing with Stripe
Create the account/subscription management page
Set up automated emails for subscription status changes
Free Tier Limitations
Implement the 3-photo limit for free accounts
Add guest count limitations (50 for free tier)
Apply watermarking/branding to free tier event pages
3. Analytics Expansion
Advanced Analytics Dashboard
Show conversion rates from views to RSVPs
Add demographic information visualization
Create exportable reports for event planners
RSVP Insights
Track when and how people are accessing event pages
Show peak times for RSVP submissions
Provide recommendations for optimal invitation timing
4. Technical Improvements
Data Management
Implement proper database indexes for performance
Set up automated backups
Create data lifecycle management (archiving old events)
Performance Optimization
Implement server-side caching for popular events
Use image optimization more aggressively
Add skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
5. Future Feature Possibilities
Integration Ecosystem
Calendar integration (Google Calendar, iCal)
Social media sharing options
Integration with video conferencing for virtual events
Advanced Notifications
SMS notifications for event creators
Reminder emails for upcoming events
Waitlist management for limited capacity events
AI Features
Smart scheduling recommendations
Automated follow-up suggestions
Guest list analysis and insights
Design Directions
I'd suggest focusing on:

Minimalist Elegance: Continue with the light ivory and black theme, but introduce subtle accent colors for different event types
Data Visualization: More visual representations of RSVP data using charts and graphs
Micro-interactions: Small animations that make the interface feel responsive and enjoyable to use
Implementation Priority
Finish core functionality: Complete any remaining foundational features
Implement monetization: Get the payment system working to start generating revenue
Add analytics: Provide value to users through data insights
Polish UI/UX: Refine the design for a premium feel
Expand features: Add integrations and advanced functionality

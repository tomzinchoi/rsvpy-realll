Current Date: {CURRENT_DATE_TIME}
Project Owner: {USER_NAME}

## Project Context

I'm developing an event page builder platform that allows users to create customized event pages with RSVP functionality. The platform will support various use cases including wedding invitations, party invites, club entrances, and small business events.

## Development Instructions

As my AI assistant, please help me implement this project following these guidelines:

### Working Process
1. **READ FIRST**: Always examine existing files before suggesting code to prevent conflicts
2. **INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT**: Focus on one feature at a time, not everything at once
3. **DOCUMENTATION**: Update process.md with progress and project_prompt.md when sections are completed
4. **TOKEN MANAGEMENT**: If you're about to run out of tokens, pause and indicate the next steps
5. **SPLIT CODE INTO FILES**: If the code is too long, split into files since it is hard to manage.

## For Each Feature Implementation

1. Check existing code for current implementation status
2. Suggest specific code changes/additions
3. Test for conflicts or issues
4. Document progress
5. Move to next priority item

When suggesting code, please focus on quality over quantity. If something seems implemented but needs improvement, suggest enhancements rather than completely new implementations.

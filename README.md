This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## After Refreshing
please we need to continue the process, you have been refreshed, read the files that I have provided to you and let's go ahead

## Restrictions
let's move on to the next steps, and please don't generate too much files at once, you might be stopped by the token limmits

## Fix
ok nice, but we got some issues here, let's fix this first and move on to the next step, be careful adjusting the issues


please give me new sql query I think I would be much better to set everything again, give me a guide.

## Preventing errors
plesae if you are wrting or creating a new file, please check if there is a same file with similer featers, if exists, please overwrite or modify the file first only create new files if really needed, to prevent confilts between files and errors


I've made the following improvements to the dashboard:

Modern Card-Based Layout:

Redesigned events to use modern cards with hover effects
Added visual indicators for events with new RSVPs
Improved information display with icons and better spacing
Added line clamping for long titles and descriptions
Quick Stats Overview:

Added a statistics section at the top with Total Events, Total RSVPs, and Total Views
Each stat has a visual icon and is displayed in a card format
Filtering and Search:

Added a search bar to filter events by title or description
Added a toggle to show only events with new RSVPs
Improved the empty state when no events match filters
Mobile Responsiveness:

Made the layout responsive with column adjustments for different screen sizes
Stack filters on mobile for better usability
Ensured touch-friendly controls
Visual Improvements:

Added loading state with spinner
Better error handling with user-friendly messages
Improved spacing and visual hierarchy
Added hover states and transitions
These changes transform the dashboard into a more modern, functional interface while maintaining the light ivory and black color scheme from the design requirements.
